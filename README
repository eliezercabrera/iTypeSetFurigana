The different pieces of this repository allow me, from a device running iOS, to create a PDF containing the Japanese lyrics of a song. Furigana are added to the lyrics.

Here follows a brief description of how the several pieces interact:

- iOS Shortcut
	-	Captures the title, artist, and lyrics of a song.
- Python script, run from Pythonista
	-	Embeds song info into a upLaTEX template.
- iOS Shortcut
	-	Saves .tex file to personal server.
- inotifywait watch script
	-	Compiles .tex files to PDF.
	-	Moves PDFs to a servable folder.
- NGINX server
	-	Serves PDFs.

The NGINX server configuration is dead simple, and thus has no place in this repository.
