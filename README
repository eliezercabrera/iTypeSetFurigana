This Python script is tested for use with Pythonista 3 for iOS.

When looking at song lyrics on lyrical-nonsense.com, the script can be run from the iOS share sheet. The scripts gets the URL, and outputs LaTeX code (upLaTeX) with the lyrics with added furigana to the clipboard.

TODOs:

* Bring the process of adding furigana offline with the Furigana Python package, if feasible within Pythonista.

* Update to Python 3, depends on previous point as the mechanize library would be dropped.

* Let user choose paper orientation instead of defaulting to landscape with vertical text.

* Output to a file.

* Pick a license.
